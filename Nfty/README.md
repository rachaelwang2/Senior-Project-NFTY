## üöÄ How to use

#### Setup

- Install node js if you don't have it already. To check, in terminal do `node -v`
- Then using `npm` from node, install Yarn: `npm install -g yarn` 
- Install dependencies for the project: `yarn install` and `npm install`
- Create an environment document from the example: `cp .env.example .env`
- Download metamask crypto wallet for chrome *and* on your phone. (Right now, the web application requires a phone wallet.) 
 
#### To Run

- `yarn run web # ios, android` 
- Issues: If you get an module not found error for '../artificats/contracts' then run `npx hardhat compile` 
- Note: ios and android simulators can't connect to a metamask wallet, because metamask isn't on your simulator phone. 

#### To edit
- Active code for the app lives in `src/`
- UI/frontend code lives in `src/views/screens`
- Firebase files live in `src/firebase` (see `.native.js` vs `.js` below) 
- Common functions live in `src/redux/actions` 
- `.native.js` vs `.js`: Files with the same name but the extension `.native.js` will only apply for the mobile versions of the app. 
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which gives you static types and powerful tooling in Visual Studio Code including autocompletion and useful inline warnings for type errors.

#### Frequent Errors 
- "Starts with undefined errors": Sometimes your machine might have trouble importing the environment variables on the Wallet Connect Screen. To resolve this error, replace the `HARDHAT_PRIVATE_KEY` with string "0x0c07142406119b6f26beec65c1332d9304ccce1ee0e7829c9802dced0185fe6d" on Wallet Connect Screen. 
- "Can't find Hello/NFT/etc.sol": In the Nfty folder, run npx hardhat compile. 
- Wallet Connect Screen always says "...Loading": The script `yarn web/android/ios` is supposed to run two processes simultaneously, but sometimes your machine will block one until you kill it. In your terminal, you should see a series of 10 Hashcodes and the output from building the app for web/android/ios. If both of those things won't work in one terminal, you have to open two terminals. In one run `npx hardhat node --hostname 0.0.0.0` and in the other run `expo web` or `react-native run-android / run-ios`.
