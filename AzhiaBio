Hi! My name is Azhia and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science on the Information Track, and minoring in Biology. I've previously worked on projects centered on increasing education access, digital healthcare, and NLP chatbots. I was on the team of 5 who created Club Cardinal, an interactive virtual version of Stanford campus. I mainly have experience in web development, and want to learn more about using ML techniques and algorithms to solve NLP problems. I'm also a premed student and am very interested in working more on digital health technologies.
