Hello there! My name is Ivan Villa-Renteria, and I'm currently a senior coterm in Computer Science. I'm on the theory track for my bachelor's, and I'm planning on focusing on either the theorerical CS track or AI track for my master's. My interests mainly lie in the intersection between theoretical CS and AI, so I'm really into things like computational complexity theory, quantum computing, algorithmic game theory, optimization, and machine learning theory. I've worked at an AI lab in UTokyo focusing on adversarial machine learning, and I've also worked on a project that uses a very certain large language model for a VR therapy chatbot, which then turned into a startup of its own. I've also taken a gap year, and during that time I worked at a small political consulting firm back home as a data science intern. When I am not coding, I am probably playing some open world jrpg. I'm also a bit of a DeFi degen.
