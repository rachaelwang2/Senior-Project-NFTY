\f0\fs24 \cf0 My name is Sara and I\'92m a senior/coterm in CS studying HCI and Theory. My background is quite complicated\'96I grew up multilingual and multicultural and I love to talk about it! In the past, I\'92ve done projects focused around personal finances, fitness, and food. I\'92m primarily focused on front-end developed and people-oriented design, but I\'92m also always interested in learning more about algorithms and back-end development. In the future, I hope I work in a more creative role focused on leveraging the power of technology for social change. Always happy to make new friends and have a conversation, so feel free to reach out. :-)}
