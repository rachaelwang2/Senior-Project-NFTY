My name is Julien Brinson and I am a senior from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a CS major with a concentration in robotics. I have had a bit of a non-traditional path through Stanford and have taken two gap years. During that time, I was able to do internships at a Y-combinator backed startup in the Bay, a robotics startup in Tokyo, Japan, and a FinTech startup in Nairobi, Kenya. (Can you tell I really like to travel?) When I'm on campus and not debugging code, you can find me walking backwards as a Stanford tour guide or enjoying anime.  

Fun fact: I have been to *every* fountain on the Stanford campus.
