<h1 align="center">Team 12: nfty</h1>

## Project Proposal 
Nfty is a camera-based app that allows users to edit their photos using generative adversarial networks automatically and then turn their pictures into NFTs (non-fungible tokens). NFTs use the ethereum blockchain to confer unique ownership to digital pieces of art. These NFTs can be bought and sold on marketplaces and creators can enable a feature to gain a percentage every time an NFT of their art is sold or changes hands. Nfty empowers creators to instantaneously create NFTs from their photos and videos and upload them to marketplaces.
