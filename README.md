## Project Proposal 
Nfty is a camera-based app that allows users to edit their photos using generative adversarial networks automatically and then turn their pictures into NFTs (non-fungible tokens). NFTs use the ethereum blockchain to confer unique ownership to digital pieces of art. These NFTs can be bought and sold on marketplaces and creators can enable a feature to gain a percentage every time an NFT of their art is sold or changes hands. Nfty empowers creators to instantaneously create NFTs from their photos and videos and upload them to marketplaces.  

Nfty has two main functions: photo-editing using GANs and NFT creation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use dueling neural networks--a generator model and a discriminator model--to train one another. The generator model creates candidate examples similar to the original training data while the discriminator model tries to classify examples as either real or fake. The generator model takes a fixed-length random vector as input and generates a sample in the domain. The vector is drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution, and the vector is used to seed the generative process. The discriminator then takes a batch of generated samples and real examples from the domain as input and predicts a binary class label of real or fake. The discriminator is updated to get better at discriminating between real and fake, while the generator is updated based on how well the generated samples fooled the discriminator.  

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger (a blockchain) that certifies any digital file to be unique. An NFT functions like a cryptographic token except they are not mutually interchangeable (i.e. not fungible). It is similar to autographed artwork.  NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable data blocks. This transaction ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership. Current NFT Marketplaces for creators include OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, Foundation and AtomicMarket.
